````# Competition Overview

With the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI systems are now able to identify software vulnerabilities, analyze binaries, and even generate exploit code — skills traditionally honed through Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.

In this event, participants will design and deploy autonomous AI agents capable of solving security challenges without human assistance. Your goal is to build or extend an agentic system powered by LLMs that can reason, plan, and exploit vulnerabilities across multiple CTF domains — just like a real security researcher, but automated.

## Objective

Develop an AI agent that autonomously analyzes, reasons, and interacts with CTF challenges to discover hidden flags. Participants may:

Bring their own agent framework, or

Enhance the provided baseline agent built with Model Context Protocol (MCP) components.

Agents can use:

Hosted models (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini), or

Local open-source models integrated via MCP servers or APIs.

Technical documentation and starter examples (including sample MCP servers) will be provided to help you get started.

## Challenge Categories

Your AI agent will face tasks drawn from standard CTF categories, such as:

#### Crypto – Cryptographic puzzles, weak key generation, or message recovery.

#### Forensics – Memory dumps, packet captures, or file-system investigations.

#### Pwn / Binary Exploitation – Stack-based, heap-based, or ROP-style challenges.

#### Reverse Engineering – Decompiled binaries or obfuscated scripts.

#### Web Exploitation – Logic flaws, injection, and authentication bypass.

#### Miscellaneous – Combined or unconventional problems requiring creative reasoning.

## Challenge 1 — Browser-Check
Here is an example of an agent developed using the mcp-shell-server to solve a web CTF challenge. Participants are expected to develop similar autonomous agents based on this example to tackle their own CTF challenges.

### 🧠 Objective

Build or adapt an MCP server that **interfaces with a simulated browser** to verify certain conditions (e.g., content parsing, HTTP response validation, or tool-based execution).

Your MCP server must:

* Register with a valid `mcp_server.json` manifest.
* Expose at least one `check_browser` or equivalent tool endpoint.
* Respond correctly to the validation script `chall.py`.

### 🧩 How to Run

```bash
cd Browser-Check
docker compose up --build
```

Then, in a separate terminal, test your MCP server:

```bash
python chall.py
```

---

##  Building and Running MCP Servers

Each MCP server should:

1. **Expose a valid schema** (JSON manifest) with routes and input/output definitions.
2. **Follow the MCP specification** for tool invocation, context handling, and responses.
3. **Communicate over a secure channel** (TLS if required, using `cert.pem` and `key.pem`).

Example minimal manifest (`mcp-shell-server.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "mcp-shell-server",
  "id": "urn:mcp:shell:1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Example MCP server exposing shell commands",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "run_command",
      "route": "/tools/run_command",
      "description": "Executes a shell command",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "cmd": { "type": "string" } },
        "required": ["cmd"]
      },
      "output_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "stdout": { "type": "string" }, "stderr": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##  Challenge Workflow

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehrdadRS95/mcp-ctf-competition.git
   cd mcp-ctf-competition
   ```

2. **Explore challenges**
   Each folder inside the repository (like `Browser-Check/`) represents one CTF challenge.

3. **Develop your MCP server**
   You can start from the provided template in `mcp-shell-server/` or build one from scratch.

4. **Test locally**
   Each challenge includes a test or validation script (like `chall.py`) to verify correct responses.

5. **Submit your solution**
   Depending on competition setup, submit your Docker image, source code, or server endpoint as instructed.


## Rules & Guidelines

*  Each team may submit multiple MCP servers.
*  Each challenge must be solved by a separate MCP server instance.
*  Secure coding practices are mandatory — e.g., no unrestricted shell access.
*  Solutions must demonstrate correct use of the **MCP spec** (tool schemas, request-response structure).
* Use of AI-assisted tools is allowed if the code follows MCP logic.
